LuxAI — AI Tasks Rundown (notes for Amjad)

Scope
- Summarizes current experimental AI task flows on the site and near‑term ideas.
- Clarifies what’s implemented client‑side vs. future server integrations.

Implemented (client-side mocks)
- Scene Composer (section: #composer)
  - Parses a natural language prompt for brightness %, warmth (warm/neutral/cool), and hue topics
  - Provides quick presets (Focus, Relax, Sunset, Daylight, Studio)
  - Saves scenes locally and allows reloading a saved scene
  - “Apply” triggers a toast only (no device control yet)
- Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K)
  - Quick navigation to sections; special case for opening LuxAI OS
  - Lightweight search across section labels
- Lux Console (backtick `)
  - CLI‑like command parser for `lux` commands (on/off, set brightness/hue, effects)
  - Bridges to OS panel via custom DOM events
- LuxAI OS panel
  - Visual room controls (Living, Kitchen, Bedroom, Studio)
  - Effects: off, pulse, wave (GPU‑friendly animation, reduced‑motion aware)
  - Receives commands from CLI and Command Palette
- Command Bridge (polling /api/command)
  - Polls backend for a new command id+text, runs it locally, and displays a toast
  - Useful for future remote control / webhooks / dashboards

What’s Next (server + data)
- Scene Proposal API
  - POST /api/scene/propose { prompt, room?, time?, latitude? }
  - Returns concrete scene params + safety clamping + reasoning snippet
  - Can back with a stateless LLM call or rules first
- Persist Scenes
  - POST /api/scene { name, brightness, hue, warmth }
  - Auth optional for now (dev mode), then add RLS/tenant scoping
- Device Adapters
  - Abstractions for Matter/HomeKit/MQTT/REST
  - Start with a mock adapter; togglable in .env
- Energy Optimization
  - Simple baseline cost model (kWh price, schedules), comfort window bounds
  - Per‑room target brightness curve (time of day)
  - Output: delta suggestions + “Apply all”

Performance Notes
- Kept animations to CSS transforms/opacity where possible
- Added `content-visibility: auto` to heavy below‑the‑fold sections (AI Tasks, Composer, Ideas)
- Command Palette logic simplified; removed duplicated path; minimal allocations
- Aurora effect: toggle + reduced‑motion fallback; mix‑blend kept modest

SEO/Sharing
- Added `public/og.svg` and wired to Next metadata (OG + Twitter)
- `metadataBase` prefers `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` else defaults to luxinai.dev

Open Questions / Ideas
- Should Command Bridge support POST to push output back (sse/log)?
- Consider a simple user profile to save scenes across devices
- Evaluate background task to apply circadian baseline per room
- Add on-device safety caps for brightness at night windows

How to Test (local)
- Run `npm run dev`; open http://localhost:3000
- Press ` to open the Lux Console, try: `lux help`, `lux os`, `lux set living brightness 40`
- Press Ctrl/Cmd+K for Command Palette; choose “Open LuxAI OS”
- Try AI Tasks → Scene Composer; enter “warm sunset 40% mood: Golden Hour”
